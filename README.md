# Math 5707: Graph Theory - Notes 

This is my collection of LaTeX notes for **Math 5707: Graph Theory** at the **University of Minnesota**. This repository is semester-long work in progress, but it will contain notes covering various topics from the course. If I decide to add exam preps and problems I will add them here. The course is at the **undergraduate level**.
